I Created a home page (Page 1) that has only an input box and a submit button, the user
should not be able to proceed to page 2 if the input box is empty, the input box must only
accept alphabets and no number or digit should be allowed.
I also Created a remover page (page 2) that takes all the strings inputted on page 1 and displays
the alphabet individually on a card.
then, While in page 2 when the user clicks on a single alphabet every duplicate of that alphabet
should be removed except the one clicked, i.e if “gdsaksgfffss” is displayed in
individual cards and the first “s” in the string is clicked the adjusted string should
become “gdsaksgfffss”.
